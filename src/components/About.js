      TextAnalyzer application offers a comprehensive set of tools for text manipulation and evaluation. It includes text conversion tools that allow users to transform their input text to either uppercase or lowercase, which is useful for emphasizing text or standardizing input for case-insensitive processing. The feature also provides text manipulation options such as clearing all text, copying text to the clipboard, and removing extra spaces within the text. These tools ensure that the text is clean, easily transferable, and free from unwanted whitespace.

In addition to these manipulation tools, the feature offers real-time text statistics. Users can see a live count of the number of words and characters in their text, which helps them meet specific requirements for assignments, articles, or social media posts. An estimated reading time is also provided, based on an average reading speed, which is particularly useful for ensuring that content is appropriately timed for presentations or speeches.

The feature also includes a preview section where users can see how their text looks after applying various transformations, providing immediate feedback and verification. Furthermore, the application supports both dark and light modes, allowing users to choose a display setting that is comfortable for their eyes, whether they are working in a well-lit environment or a darker setting. Overall, the "Analyse Your Text" feature is a powerful and user-friendly tool for anyone who needs to manipulate and evaluate text effectively.
